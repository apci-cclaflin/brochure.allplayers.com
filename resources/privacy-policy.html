When you register for a group, the information collected during registration is presented to the appropriate organization within our member management solution, which you control through your privacy settings. In some cases where your privacy settings permit it (e.g., posting a comment to your profile page feature), other AllPlayers.com users may be able to add information to your profile, but you will always maintain control of your profile through your privacy settings and site features (e.g., deleting a posted comment feature). At AllPlayers.com, we strive to provide you with the best possible online experience and manage your transactions exactly as you've requested. In order to do this, we collect information that allows us to:</p>

	<li>Provide the services that you request and process payments in conjunction with those requests</li>
	<li>Contact you about the status of a transaction</li>

The primary goal is to place parents in control over what information is collected from their child online.</p>
<p>AllPlayers.com is very serious about total compliance with COPPA and has put the following provisions in place to ensure that every child’s privacy is protected.  COPPA defines a child as their age being 12 and under.</p>
