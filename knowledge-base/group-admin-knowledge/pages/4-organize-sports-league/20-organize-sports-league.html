  <h2>{{ page.title }}</h2>
  <p>AllPlayers.com provides all the tools you need to organize and manage your sports league.</p>
  <p>With AllPlayers.com, you can set up leagues, divisions, and teams, then automatically create your season schedules. Your coaches will be able to administer their own team pages, where members can share photos, carry on conversations to set up carpools, snack schedules, and more. You and your coaches will easily be able to communicate events like rainouts and cancellations using our broadcast messaging tools.</p>
  <p>Before we set up our sports league, it's important to understand the basic concepts of <b>Groups Above</b> and <b>Groups Below (Subgroups)</b>.</p>
  <img src="images/knowledge/group-chart-org.png">
  <p>In this illustration, Springfield Recreation Center is the main group above. Each subgroup below the main organization may also have additional subgroups.</p>
  <p>For example, the 10-year-old 2011 Boys Winter Basketball League has a group above of 2011 Boys Basketball (which contains all age divisions), and six groups below (subgroups), each team in the division.</p>
  <p>Organizing your groups as illustrated above allows you to easily maintain your groups not only for the current season, but for future and past (archived) seasons.</p>
  <div class="twelve columns alert-box">
    <p>We recommend building a chart similar to the illustration above if you are organizing sports leagues for an organization. It's a great way to stay organized and maintain your league and team pages moving forward through new sports seasons.</p>

  <h3>Recommendations for naming teams and leagues</h3>
  <p>For a sports league, naming your league, divisions, and teams may require some thought before you create your groups on AllPlayers.com.</p>
  <p>Visitors can search AllPlayers.com to find groups in their area that offer activities. For that reason, we suggest that you have one main group for your organization, and build subgroups under your main group to feature your leagues and/or programs.</p>
  <hr />

  <h4>Identify your organization in search terms</h4>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="six columns">
      <p>When you create your Subgroups, we recommend including your main organization's name in the <strong>Search Terms</strong> field for your group. This will help visitors easily identify leagues, divisions and teams that are a part of your organization.</p>
      <p>For example, there may be dozens of groups on AllPlayers.com named "Youth Basketball" or "U12." When you identify your organization in the <strong>Search Terms</strong> field, your organization's name will appear along with your subgroup's name in a user's list of their groups, as well as in the search results for groups on AllPlayers.com.</p>

  <h4>Include coach name in team name</h4>
  <p>Many sports teams use common names. For example, did you know that Eagles, Bears, Wildcats and Tigers are among the most popular team nicknames? Your league may have teams with these very names. Another possibility is that you may have a team named "Eagles" in every age division in your league.</p>
  <p>We recommend including the coach's name in your team name. This method offers three advantages:</p>
  <ul class="content">
    <li>If more than one team in your league has the same name, including the coach's name will make the team's group name unique.</li>
    <li>If a team that you create is new and does not yet have a name, including the coach's name will easily identify the unnamed team.</li>
    <li>If the coach's name is included in the group's name, it creates an identifier that can help you easily identify coach scheduling conflicts at a glance when you review game schedules.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Create your top group</h3>
  <p>When you've created your organizational chart and chosen suitable names, you're ready to begin building your groups at AllPlayers.com.</p>
  <p>In our <a href="images/knowledge/group-chart-org.png">example</a>, the top group is Springfield Recreation Center.</p>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="six columns">
      <p>To create your top group:</p>
      <p>Log in to your account or <a href="knowledge-base/basic-user-knowledge/pages/1-create-an-account/01-create-an-account.html">create a new account</a>.</p>
      <p>In the upper menu bar, go to <b>Groups > Create a Group</b>.</p>
      <p>Complete the group creation form.</p>
      <p><i>For full details on creating a group, see our <a href="knowledge-base/group-admin-knowledge/pages/1-group-admin-guide/04-create-your-group.html">group creation guide</a>.</i></p>

    <div class="six columns">
      <img class="kbImage" src="images/knowledge/admin_guide-org_create_top_group-group_click.jpg">
      <div class="kbImageLarge">
        <img src="images/knowledge/admin_guide-org_create_top_group-group_click-large.jpg">
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <br />
  <div class="twelve columns alert-box">
    <p>We recommend that you choose <strong>Association</strong> for your top group's type. <br /> However, if you will be integrating with <i>Quickscores</i>, you will need to use <strong>League</strong> as your top group's type.</p>
  </div>
  <hr />

  <h3>Create your subgroups</h3>
  <p>Once you have created your top group, you are ready to create your subgroups.</p>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="six columns">
      <p>To create a subgroup under an existing group:</p>
      <p>Navigate to the group page of your top group.</p>
      <p>In your group toolbox, navigate to <strong>Create a Subgroup</strong>.</p>
      <p>Complete the group creation form.</p>
      <p><i>For full details on creating a group, see our <a href="knowledge-base/group-admin-knowledge/pages/1-group-admin-guide/04-create-your-group.html">group creation guide</a>.</i></p>

      <div class="kbImageLarge">
        <img src="images/knowledge/admin_guide-org_create_subgroup-group_click-large.jpg">
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <br />
  <div class="twelve columns alert-box">
    <p>The group category that you choose when creating your subgroups will be dependent on how you have set up your organization structure. <br /> However, if you will be integrating with <i>Quickscores</i>, you will need to create a <strong>Division</strong> under your <strong>League</strong> top group. Under the <strong>Division</strong> group, you will need to create <strong>Team</strong> subgroups.</p>
  </div>

  <h3>Duplicate a group</h3>
  <p>Once you have created a subgroup, if you need more subgroups under the same top group, you can easily create multiple clones of your existing subgroup.</p>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="six columns">
      <p>To clone an existing subgroup:</p>
      <p>Navigate to the group page of your top group.</p>
      <p>In your group toolbox, navigate to <strong>Create a Subgroup</strong></p>
      <p>Next to the subgroup you would like to clone, click <strong>Create a copy of this group</strong>.</p>
      <p><i>For full details on creating a group, see our <a href="knowledge-base/group-admin-knowledge/pages/1-group-admin-guide/04-create-your-group.html">group creation guide</a>.</i></p>
