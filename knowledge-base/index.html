  <p>YES! This is the great thing about AllPlayers.com. Because it is free, it is a great solution for groups to use, no matter how big or small the group. Currently, AllPlayers.com is not only used by large recreational organizations, but also small book clubs, dance instructors, bands, parent-teacher organizations and even families. Try it out and see for yourself!</p>

<div id="question2" class="reveal-modal [expand, xlarge, large, medium, small]">
  <p>We use authorize.net as a payment gateway and we are PCI compliant. As a merchant who accepts credit card transactions, AllPlayers.com is required to be compliant with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). PCI DSS is a set of comprehensive requirements developed by the major card brands to facilitate the adoption of consistent data security measures.</p>

<div id="question3" class="reveal-modal [expand, xlarge, large, medium, small]">
  <p>Websites that are collecting information from children under the age of thirteen are required to comply with Federal Trade Commission Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).
COPPA is just the starting point for security at AllPlayers.com. We raise the compliance bar with our COPPA+ Guardian Watch.
COPPA+ Guardian Watch is the new standard in protecting children online, and we are proud to say we did it first. COPPA+ Guardian Watch is the first service that verifies a child's guardian through face-to-face confirmation by a trusted source, like a coach, teacher or mentor. It keeps the parent in total control 100% of the time.
Parents and guardians control what features are accessible to their children. This includes viewing friends and messages. Parents can always stay informed, aware and on guard.
AllPlayers.com takes the privacy of our members and their families seriously.</p>
